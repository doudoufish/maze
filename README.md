# Maze Project
Use Bellman Ford’s Algorithm to find the shortest path of a maze.
Also it will comparing the performance of Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Bellman Ford’s Algorithm.
we will comparing by the Big-O and how many shortest path in each algorithm.
# Big-O
- ### Bellman Fords algorithms:
  It is more time consuming. The time complexity is O(VE).
- ### Dijkstras algorithms:
  It is less time consuming. The time complexity is O(E logV).
  
# Steps
- ### Bellman Fords algorithms:
  show in the table it is 2 cycle and each cycel have 14 steps, tatal is 28 steps
- ### Dijkstras algorithms:
  It seens have 14  step in the analysis tables.

# Conclustion
- In the big-O, The time complexity is Dijkstras algorithms less than Bellman Fords algorithms. 
- The step is also less than Bellman Ford’s algorithm,because it have more than one cycles.
- Dijkstras algorithms: the result contains the vertices containing whole information about the network.
- The Bellman Ford is contains the vertices they are connected to.
